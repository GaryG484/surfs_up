## Overview
### A summary of the Surfs Up Project:

##### I was tasked with gathering temperature data for the island of Oahu to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.  At first, I looked at precipitation but then shifted focus to temperature as rain didn’t appear to be an issue for the client. Specifically, I looked at the months of June and December to get an idea of the minimum and maximum temperatures of the island. 


## Surfs Up Results
### Temperatures for June and December

##### After parsing through the CSV files and creating new table I discovered four things:
* Junes mean temperature was ~~75 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The minimum temperature for June was 64 degrees Fahrenheit. 
* The maximum temperature for June was 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

* Decembers mean temperature was ~~71 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The minimum temperature for December was 56 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The maximum temperature for December was 83 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Surfs Up Summary
### Perfect weather for ice cream and surfing:

##### Looking at the temperatures for two opposite points of the year we can see that there is not a huge variance in temperature. The average temperatures of the two months are only 4 degrees apart. The minimum temperatures are only a little over 10 degrees different, and the maximum temperature are only different by 2 degrees.  This suggests that the temperature does not vary to a severe degree on the island of Oahu, creating the perfect temperatures for surfing. With a minimum temperature in December of only the mid 50’s, the ice cream portion of the business might even be sustainable in the coldest parts of the year. One other query that we should run would look at the precipitation of these two months specifically. Another query that I would suggest is wind speed, as it could affect the size of the waves coming in as well as have factors that could affect how hot or cold these temperatures feel like.
